<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>As a project for the Harvard MOOC <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/">CS 50</a>, I worked to create a game similar to the classic “breakout” game. In this game, a ball travels around a box, and when All of the code was written in C. I relied on some course-provided graphics APIs in order to render the scenes of the game.</p>
