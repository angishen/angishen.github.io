## About

As a project for the Harvard MOOC [CS 50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/), I worked to create a game similar to the classic "breakout" game. In this game, a ball travels around a box, and when All of the code was written in C. I relied on some course-provided graphics APIs in order to render the scenes of the game.

## Some things I learned from completing CS 50:

* CS 50 taught me data structures and algorithms such as searching and sorting algorithms.

* Through completing this course, I gained a strong working knowledge of the C programming language.

* CS 50 also taught me the fundamentals of computer architecture and operating systems.

## Technologies

* C
