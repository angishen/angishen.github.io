## About

I completed the well known [Ruby on Rails tutorial by Michael Hartl](https://www.railstutorial.org/). The final and most significant coding exercise outlined in this tutorial was to make a dynamic website which supports much of the same functionality as Twitter. Through completing this tutorial and building this website, I gained a solid understanding of Ruby on Rails, and I acquired hands on experience building the main components of a professional-grade, client facing website.

## Some project highlights:

* Users can create and edit profiles on the site which persist via mySQL on the server side.

* Users can create and edit mini "blog posts" on the site; users can see posts from other users whom they follow.

* The website is integrated with [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/marketing/sendgrid-services?cvosrc=PPC.Google.sendgrid&cvo_cid=SendGrid%20-%20US%20-%20Brand%20-%20(English)&mc=Paid%20Search&mcd=AdWords&keyword=sendgrid&network=g&matchtype=e&mobile=&content=&search=1&gclid=Cj0KEQiAxMG1BRDFmu3P3qjwmeMBEiQAEzSDLsE800whPBBEhVIsP5NfmihDsAv9W2QD4w1YGNz0yo8aArAA8P8HAQ) mail client. Users can opt in for email notifications when a someone they follow creates a new post.

* The site is [live](https://glacial-reaches-6236.herokuapp.com/) and hosted through Amazon Web Services and Heroku. In creating the site, I got the opportunity to learn about how to configure and launch on both AWS and Heroku.
