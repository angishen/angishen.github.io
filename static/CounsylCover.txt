In addition to having an M.S. in computer science and professional work experience at top software companies, I have taken many college courses in the field of biology, and I have conducted research in genetic algorithms at the Wilke Lab (see http://wilke.openwetware.org/). For these reasons, I think I bring more background to this job than other applicants. I am passionate about genomics, and I feel at Counsyl I could apply my problem solving skills to help push forward the state of the art in DNA sequencing.
