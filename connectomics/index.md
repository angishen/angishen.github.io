## About

For this project, I am working with two graduate students at the University of Texas. Their backgrounds are in biology and statistics. We attempted the [Kaggle Connectomics Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectomics). This project was motivated primarily by my research in neural coding, a course on statistical methods and neural coding that I was taking at the time, and my love for data analytic challenges. The general goal of the project is to infer
the connectome (i.e., a comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain) from correlations in neuronal activity. It is relatively easy to observe neuronal activity spikes
but comparatively very difficult to determine connections between neurons.

For this project, we have received input and support from [Dr. Jonathan Pillow](http://pillowlab.princeton.edu/) who now resides at Princeton University (previously was at the University of Texas).
