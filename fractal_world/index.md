## About

This was a quick project I did for a [graduate course](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/fussell/courses/cs384g/) I took in computer graphics. I made two different worlds (one which is moon-like and the other which is mountainous) through which the user can traverse via the keypad. 

The basic idea behind the implementation involves tracing rays on the GPU in real-time into a world whose geometry is implied by a pseudo-random function. For lighting, I utilized the [Phong reflection model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model). I am able to get a reasonable frame rate while tracing the rays three "rebounds" deep. The clouds are rendered using a [ray marching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_ray_casting) technique.

The pseudo-random function I used to generate the terrain is basically a hash function that takes in two coordinates, x and y, and hashes them to produce the height, z, at point (x, y) in the simulated world. To make the terrain look smoother, I interpolated and smoothsteped nearby height values.

## Some project highlights:

* Able to trace rays three levels deep in real-time.

* Incorporated the ability for the user to "jump" (motion is governed by the standard kinematics equation for acceleration due to gravity).

* Able to achieve real-time anti-aliasing by shooting multiple rays through each pixel and averaging their color.

* Water appears when the user moves below a certain height in the world. The water reflects light rays and has ripples on the surface which are generated by a time-varying sinusoidal function which perturbs the water height and normals.
